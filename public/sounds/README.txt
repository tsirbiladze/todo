You'll need to replace them with actual audio content for the Focus Mode to work properly.

## TROUBLESHOOTING
If you see errors like "NotSupportedError: Failed to load because no supported source was found":
1. Make sure the audio files exist in this directory
2. Ensure they are valid MP3 files (the placeholders might not work in all browsers)
3. Replace the placeholders with actual audio content
