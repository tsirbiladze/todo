Core Principles (Keep these in mind):

Minimize Cognitive Load: Reduce distractions, choices, and complex interactions.

Maximize Clarity: Make information visually distinct, easy to parse, and readily available.

Flexibility and Customization: ADHD presents differently in everyone; allow users to tailor the app.

Positive Reinforcement: Celebrate progress and make task management less daunting.

Rapid Input, Rapid Feedback: Quick interactions are essential.

Feature Ideas (Categorized and Prioritized):

I. High-Impact, Core Feature Enhancements (Highest Priority)

Improved Recurring Tasks [DONE]: The current RecurringTask model in prisma/schema.prisma has the basic building blocks (frequency, interval, daysOfWeek, dayOfMonth, monthOfYear), but the application needs to fully utilize these. The scripts/test-migration.js demonstrates basic task creation but does not cover recurring tasks in depth. The API endpoint at /api/recurring-tasks/route.ts shows logic for calculating next occurrences, which needs refinement.

Specific Enhancements:

UI for Complex Recurrence Patterns [DONE]: A user-friendly interface (likely within AddTaskForm.tsx and EditTaskForm.tsx) to easily set up:

"Every [X] days/weeks/months/years" [DONE]

"On specific days of the week" (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri) [DONE]

"On the [Xth] day of the month" [DONE]

"On the [first/second/third/last] [weekday] of the month" [DONE]

"Repeat [X] times" or "Until [date]" [DONE]

Preview of Future Occurrences [DONE]: Show the user a list or calendar preview of the next 5-10 generated tasks.

Handling Missed Occurrences [DONE]: Options for what happens if a recurring task's due date has passed without being completed:

Automatically reschedule to the next occurrence. [DONE]

Prompt the user to reschedule. [DONE]

Mark as "missed" but keep the next occurrence as scheduled. [DONE]

Edit Series vs. Single Instance [DONE]: Allow the user to edit all future occurrences of a recurring task or just a single instance (e.g., to reschedule just one day's meeting). This requires careful database design to handle "exceptions" to the recurring pattern.

Testing: Thorough testing of all recurrence patterns and edge cases, extending src/__tests__/api/tasks.test.ts and potentially adding dedicated recurring task tests.

Enhanced Focus Mode [DONE] (High Priority - Builds on Existing Functionality): The FocusMode.tsx component, PomodoroTimer.tsx, and the public/sounds/ directory provide a foundation, but we can significantly improve this. scripts/create-sample-sounds.js and scripts/fetch-real-sounds.js hint at the sound-related features.

Specific Enhancements:

Sound Customization [DONE]: Allow users to adjust the volume of each sound independently (ambient sounds, brainwave entrainment, bell). Consider a simple mixer interface.

Sound Looping and Fade-In/Out [DONE]: Ensure smooth, seamless audio transitions.

Brainwave Entrainment Refinement [DONE]: The current placeholders are insufficient. Either:

Integrate a Library: Use a JavaScript library that can generate binaural beats (this is complex but ideal).

Curated Sound Files: Provide a selection of carefully chosen and verified binaural beat audio files (ensure licensing compliance!). Explain the purpose of each frequency range clearly.

Visual Focus Aids [DONE]: Consider adding options like:

Full-Screen Mode [DONE]: Minimize distractions further.

Visual Timer [DONE]: A large, clear countdown timer (potentially with color changes).

"Breathing" Animation [DONE]: A subtle, calming visual cue to encourage mindful breathing.

Focus Session Logging [DONE]: The FocusSession model is there; ensure focus sessions are reliably logged, including the associated task (if any). This feeds into analytics.

AI Focus Coach [DONE]: Implement the AIFocusCoach.tsx component functionality. It should send request to /api/ai/advanced/route.ts.

TTS Feature [DONE]: Implement the TTS features as per the TTS-FEATURE.md. Make sure the api route /api/tts/route.ts works correctly.

Improved Task Prioritization and Sorting (High Priority - Core Workflow): The Priority enum exists in prisma/schema.prisma, but the UI (TaskList.tsx, AddTaskForm.tsx) needs to make better use of it.

Specific Enhancements:

Visual Priority Indicators: Use clear icons and colors (consistent with Category colors) to represent priority levels. Make these very prominent in Task.tsx and TaskCard.tsx.

Sorting Options: Allow users to sort tasks by:

Priority

Due Date

Estimated Duration

Creation Date

"Urgent/Important" Matrix View (Eisenhower Matrix): A more advanced view that helps users visualize tasks based on both urgency (due date) and importance (priority). This could be a separate view mode within TaskList.tsx.

Smart Suggestions: (Longer-term) Use AI to suggest a priority based on the task title and description.

Enhanced Search and Filtering (High Priority - Addressing Refactoring Point): The TaskSearch.tsx component provides basic search; expand this significantly.

Specific Enhancements:

Filter by Category: Allow users to see only tasks from specific categories.

Filter by Priority: Show only tasks of a certain priority level.

Filter by Due Date: "Today," "Tomorrow," "This Week," "Overdue," "No Due Date."

Filter by Status: "Completed," "Active"

Filter by Emotion: "Excited", "Neutral", "Anxious", etc.

Combined Filters: Allow users to combine multiple filters (e.g., "Show me all High priority tasks in the Work category due this week").

Saved Filters: Allow users to save frequently used filter combinations.

II. Medium-Impact, Usability Enhancements (Medium Priority)

Quick Entry with Natural Language Processing (NLP): (Medium Priority - Adds Convenience)

Specific Enhancements:

Single Input Field: A prominent input field (perhaps at the top of TaskList.tsx) where users can type something like: "Call John tomorrow at 2pm #Work @High"

NLP Parsing: Use a JavaScript library (or a serverless function) to parse this input and extract:

Task Title

Due Date/Time

Category (using # as a prefix)

Priority (using @ as a prefix)

(Potentially) Duration

Instant Feedback: As the user types, show a preview of how the task will be created.

Drag-and-Drop Task Ordering/Prioritization: (Medium Priority - Improves Interaction)

Specific Enhancements:

Within TaskList.tsx: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to reorder them within a list (e.g., to manually prioritize within a category).

Between Lists (Optional): If you have multiple lists (e.g., "Today," "This Week"), allow dragging tasks between them.

Keyboard Shortcuts: (Medium Priority - Power User Feature)

Specific Enhancements:

Add global keyboard shortcuts for:

Creating a new task (e.g., Ctrl/Cmd + N)

Opening Focus Mode (e.g., Ctrl/Cmd + F)

Navigating between tasks (e.g., arrow keys)

Completing a task (e.g., Enter)

Editing a task (e.g., Ctrl/Cmd + E)

Deleting a task (e.g., Delete/Backspace)

Use existing library lib/shortcuts.ts

User Onboarding: (Medium Priority - Improve First Impression)

Add the tours when user start the app.

Explain main features.

Calendar Integration: (Medium Priority - Synchronization)

Specific Enhancements:

Two-Way Sync: Allow users to sync their tasks with external calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc.). This requires:

Authentication with the external calendar service.

A mechanism to map tasks to calendar events (and vice versa).

Handling updates, deletions, and recurring events.

Display Calendar Events: Show calendar events within the app's calendar view (TaskCalendarView.tsx), perhaps in a different color.

III. Lower-Impact, "Nice-to-Have" Features (Lower Priority)

Gamification: (Low Priority - Could be Engaging)

Specific Enhancements:

Points/Rewards: Award points for completing tasks, maintaining streaks, etc.

Badges/Achievements: Unlock badges for milestones (e.g., "Completed 100 tasks," "Used Focus Mode for 7 days straight").

Leaderboards (Optional): If you add social features (see below), consider leaderboards (but be mindful of privacy and potential anxiety).

Collaboration/Social Features: (Low Priority - Consider Carefully)

Specific Enhancements:

Shared Task Lists: Allow users to share task lists with others (e.g., for team projects or family chores).

Task Assignment: Assign tasks to specific users within a shared list.

Comments/Discussion: Add comments to tasks for collaboration.

Important Considerations:

Privacy: Be very careful with user data and privacy if you add social features.

Complexity: Collaboration adds significant complexity to the application.

Focus: Don't let social features distract from the core purpose of the app (focused task management).

More Advanced Analytics

Add the charts and graphs.

Add more data to the dashboard.

Technical Considerations and Implementation Notes:

Next.js API Routes: Continue to leverage Next.js API routes (src/app/api/) for backend logic. This is a good choice for a full-stack application.

Prisma: Prisma is a solid ORM choice. Make sure your schema (prisma/schema.prisma) is well-designed to support the features you add. Use Prisma's migration tools to manage schema changes.

Zustand: Zustand is a good choice for client-side state management. Keep your store well-organized (lib/store.ts).

Tailwind CSS: Continue using Tailwind for consistent styling.

Testing: Expand your test coverage (src/__tests__/) as you add new features. Pay particular attention to edge cases and error handling.

Database: Ensure migration to MySQL from SQLite is completed and stable, including checking for any potential data loss or corruption during the migration process.

Type Conversions: Review and update any custom type conversion functions to ensure compatibility with the new database and Prisma schema.

Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling, especially in API routes and data-fetching functions. Use try...catch blocks and provide informative error messages to the user.

Accessibility: Pay close attention to accessibility (a11y) throughout the development process. Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and test with screen readers.

Validation: Refactor /lib/server/validation.ts to use in more components.

Development Process:

Prioritize: Focus on the High-Priority features first.

Iterate: Don't try to build everything at once. Implement features in small, manageable increments.

Test Thoroughly: Write unit and integration tests for each new feature.

Get Feedback: If possible, get feedback from users (especially users with ADHD) throughout the development process.
